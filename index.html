                    <h2>My Love Letter to You</h2>
                    <p>Dear Janella,</p>
                    <p>First of all Merry Christmas, you are the most precious blessing I have ever received this year, you made me the happiest person ever since I met you, I know you have read this somewhere but I will repeat it here anyways "I will always cherish every moment with you" because every moment with you feels like home. janella just know that hindi kita susukuan, kase I know you are worth it. I am gonna learn how to love you. I am not going anywhere. so take your time. also I want you to know that you are my favorite person, my peace, and my heart's greatest gift. My only wish for christmas is to keep creating more memories with you.</p>
                    <p>Hindi man ako yung best person out of all the people you have met, but i want you to know na I have always  been sincere in my feelings for you. I have never ever pretended to love you, because my emotions have been genuine from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>As this year comes to an end, I want you to know that you still have me next year I promise you that I will stay and prove to you that I am always here and that I am not going to leave you. I will stay with you even at your lowest. I will be here, steady and sure, just as I have always been, and just as I always will be.</p>
                    <p>I will love you in ways others may never understand, and I will choose you in ways they never could. With you, I am willing to risk everything—even my own happiness—if it means protecting yours.</p>
                    <p>And when the time comes that the world turns its back on you, I will stand behind you and hold you close, making sure you know that I will be the one who believes in you, even when you can no longer believe in yourself.</p>
                    <p>With all my love,</p>
                    <p>Your Special Someone</p>

                                <p>This song remind me of you, eto kasi yung first song natin sa playlist diba madami syang covers but the one you like is yung kay kina grannis, also kase if you know the meaning of iris is "it means being ready to sacrifice everything that the person have just to be with someone he love, that he is ready to give it all just to hold her arms because just like the lyrics it has "You are the closest to heaven that I'll ever be, and I don't wanna lose you"</p>
                                <p>Janella Areñavo you are and will always be my Iris.</p>

                                <p>This song actually just remind me of one in a thousand memories I have with you, I remember you added this sa playlist naten i said na this song ni conan gray is maganda and you replied "alin dun? nervous?" HAHAHA it was actually so funny and even tho it is just little thing i still remember it. I actually thougth na mali si conan gray ng title kase baka ikaw talaga yung gumawa nung kanta ><</p>

                                <p>This song I remember na inadd mo to, but you are kind of unsure kung okay ba mag add ng talagalog song kase mostly that time puro lang tayo english songs sa playlist, kaya nung inalis mo ulit tinanong kita then you said 3 times mo sya nilagay haha, then ending ako nalang nag add sa playlist. that song is actually one of the best tagalog song I have heard also   yung meaning ng song ang ganda</p>
                                <p>would you be my Co-Pilot?</p>
